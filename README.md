# mini-inventory-tracker
Just a small inventory program. I'm very new to python and thought this would be a fun little project.  My inspiration for this started with "where the hell did i put that thing?" Lol. But this could be used for many inventory and location-tracking purposes. Or "I put that thing somewhere the kid couldn't mess with it and now i can't remember where i put it..." type purposes.
